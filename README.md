## ðŸ“‚ Contents of the Report

The report includes the following sections:

1. **Screenshots from the Tool**

   * Images captured during password strength evaluation tests.
   * Visual feedback from the tool showing how different passwords scored.

2. **Scores and Feedback**

   * A summary of the evaluation results.
   * Explanation of how scores reflect password resistance to brute-force and dictionary attacks.

3. **Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords**

   * Recommendations such as using long, complex, and unique passwords.
   * Guidance on password managers and passphrases.

4. **Tips Learned from the Evaluation**

   * Lessons observed from the tool, such as how length and randomness improve strength.
   * Why predictable substitutions (e.g., `P@ssw0rd`) donâ€™t offer strong protection.

5. **Common Password Attacks**

   * Description of brute-force attacks.
   * Explanation of dictionary attacks and other threats like credential stuffing.

6. **Impact of Password Complexity**

   * How increasing length and diversity of characters strengthens security.
   * Mathematical comparison of possible combinations for weak vs. strong passwords.

7. **Conclusion**

   * Summary of findings and recommendations for better password hygiene.
